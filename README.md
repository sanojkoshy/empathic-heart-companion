# Empathic Heart Companion üß†‚ù§Ô∏è

## Basic Details
### Team Name: Heartfelt Hackers

### Team Members
- Team Lead: Sanoj Koshy - [sree buddha college of engineering,pattoor]



### Project Description
An AI-powered emotional support chatbot designed to respond with empathy, provide mental wellness prompts, and pretend it's not just GPT wrapped in kindness.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People need someone to talk to... but friends, therapists, and actual humans are *so* overrated.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built a chatbot that listens, cares, and responds with just the right amount of synthetic sympathy. It's like therapy, but less effective‚Äîand free!
